 Structure defining the operation when sorting an Int array.
 There are two kinds of operations. You can either *swap* the values, indicated
 by the indexes *first* and *second*. Or you can *move* the *value* in *first* variable to the *index*
 specified by the *second* index value.
 currentIndex1 and currentIndex2 are indexes to the array the sorting method is currently "keeping focus on".
 These are drawn as small circles in the centerline of the numbers.

/**
 A common protocol for all sorting methods.
 
 Note that the array to be sorted is hosted in an external object, and provided
 to the sorting methods as a parameter to the `nextStep()` method. Each execution of
 the nextStep() executes one relevant step of the sorting algorithm, usually leading into
 values changing places in the array to be sorted. This can then be animated in the UI.
 
 Protocol implementations must also implement `realAlgorithm()`, executing the sorting method
 in a tight loop. This is not animated in the UI, but used in comparing the speed of the
 algorithms.
 
 Note that when giving an array to be sorted to various sorting methods, the
 array each of them starts with must contain the same numbers in the same order -- otherwise
 the comparisons are not fair.

    call to nextStep.

     - array: The array containing the elements to sort.
     - swappedItems: The two items to swap or move, if any. Method sets the values and caller does the moving.

    - Returns: Returns true if the array is sorted. Caller should stop sorting (calling nextStep).
